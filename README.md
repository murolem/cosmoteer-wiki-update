## About

Scripts for mass updating pages (and templates) over on [**Cosmoteer wiki**](https://cosmoteer.wiki.gg/).

Based on https://github.com/RheingoldRiver/sorcerer-update.

## Dev

Uses `venv`.

Updates to templates are done in `update_template.py`.

Notes about some dependencies:
- `mwcleric` is also installed directly from its [repo](https://github.com/RheingoldRiver/mwcleric) since it has some important fixes not yet in the release version that make life easier.
